<br>In all cases, the "EVERYONE" group has been partitioned into racial groups such that a person of mixed ancestry from racial groups A and B is counted as half of a person from racial group A and half of a person from racial group B. For example, by this partitioning, Barrack Oabama counts as 1 person in the "EVERYONE" group, and he also counts for 0.5 people in the "WHITE" group and 0.5 people in the "BLACK" group.
<br>CFR: the <a href=https://www.stat.fi/meta/kas/hedelmallisyys_en.html style="text-decoration: underline;"">crude fertility rate</a> is an approximation of the total fertility rate. The CFR is calculated as the ratio of the size of the youngest cohort to the average size of cohorts of fertile adults, or fertile women, depending on context.
<br>REPL is the replication rate, which is my modification of the crude fertility rate that only considers the ratio of daughters to mothers. I believe the replication rate is more informative than the crude fertility rate because women have a tighter fertile window that closes at age 45 in most cases, and because the replication rate sidesteps the possibility that different racial groups may have significantly different gender ratios at birth.
<br>ACE is the annual cohort exchange, which is the difference between the number of daughters born in a year and the average number of women who leave the oldest fertile cohort in a year.
