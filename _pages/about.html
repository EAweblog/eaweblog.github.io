<p>The Eternal Anglo weblog is named after the debut project on this website: the <a href=/fertility-appendix/ style="text-decoration: underline;">Fertility Project</a>, which (initially) includes only Anglosphere countries. The reason being that Anglosphere countries are the easiest countries to get population data by age, sex, and race. From <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_censuses>Wikipedia</a>:</p>
