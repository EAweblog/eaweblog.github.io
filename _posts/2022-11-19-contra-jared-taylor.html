        <a href='#FL1' id="FN1">^</a> The <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/search/series/">NACJD</a> - National Archive of Criminal Justice Data - is a collection of various datasets available for full download, including a few very useful ones like the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), and the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), which are cited extensively in Edwin Rubinstein's <a href=https://archive.colorofcrime.com/2016/03/the-color-of-crime-2016-revised-edition/><em>The Color of Crime</em></a>. I'm adding a link to the NACJD to my sidebar.

I'm adding a link to the ICPSR to my sidebar.
